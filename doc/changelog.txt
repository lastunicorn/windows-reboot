WindowsReboot Change Log
========================

Version 1.4
-----------

- I added the Sleep and Hibernate actions.
- I added an "Options" panel from where the user can set 3 options:
	a) minimize the application to tray icon instead of minimizing to taskbar.
	b) minimize to tray instead of closing the application when the user clicks the "X" button of the window.
	c) Start the timer immediately as the application starts using the previously saved configuration (action time, action type).

Version 1.3
-----------

Obs! This is the first public release of the application.

- I rewrote the code in c#.net (2.0). The previous versions were written in vb.net (1.1).
- I made some changes to the design. I added the yellow clock image at the top of the window. I changed the icon.
- I added the "Configuration" menu from where the user can current window configuration (action time, action type) for the next time the application starts.
